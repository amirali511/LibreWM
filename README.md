# LibreWM

## ATTENTION: IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT!

LibreWM is a wayland compositor which is designed for being simple, fast, and hackable. It uses wlroots under the hood, and is brought to you by someone interested in
window managers and compositors.

## Installing
You need to install vlang before anything, so you can see how to do in [here](https://vlang.io).

Arch:
`sudo pacman -S wlroots && sudo pacman -S base-devel`

## Running
You can execute in the root directory of this project:
`v run runner.v`
